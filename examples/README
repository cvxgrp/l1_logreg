train_*
    train_iono          : script for training on ionosphere dataset

classify_*
    classify_iono       : script for classification over the training 
                          ionosphere dataset

regpath_*
    regpath_iono        : script for generating a regularization path of
                          ionosphere dataset

A train_<problem> script does training over a given dataset (feature matrix mmrx_<problem>_A, class vector mmrx_<problem>_b). Then it generates a model file, out<problem>.

A classify_<problem> script does classification over a test dataset (here, we used the same dataset that is used for training). Classification requres the model file that is generated from training, and generates an result file res<problem> which contains the classification result of the test dataset.
